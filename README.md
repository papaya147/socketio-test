# socketio-test
Enter the client directory and install dependencies:
```
cd client
npm i
```

The client can now be started using:
```
npm start
```

Now enter the server directory and install dependencies:
```
cd ../server
npm i
```

The server can also be started with:
```
npm start
```

To test the socket connection, go to [port 4001 on localhost](http://localhost:4001/). Now your server terminal should have some output!
