# socketio-test
Enter the client directory and install dependencies:
        cd client
        npm i

The client can now be started using:
        npm start

Now enter the server directory and install dependencies:
        cd ../server
        npm i

The server can also be started with:
        npm start

To test the socket connection, go to [port 4000 on localhost](http://localhost:4000/). Now your server terminal should have some output!
